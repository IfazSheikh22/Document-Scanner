Document Scanner
This is a document scanner program implemented in Python using OpenCV. The program takes an image of a document as input, detects the edges of the document, and applies a perspective transform to get a top-down view of the document.

To run the program, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your machine. You also need an image of a document named ‘document.jpg’ in the same directory as the script. You can then run the program with the following command: python document_scanner.py
